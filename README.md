The objective was to forecast peak traffic between 4 PM and 8 PM by analyzing temporal patterns. Initial analysis confirmed the presence of seasonality but no significant trend, as verified by the PyMann-Kendall test (P-value > 0.05). Traditional Exponential Smoothing methods failed to provide accurate predictions, prompting a deeper analysis of data stationarity using ACF and PACF. ARIMA and SARIMA models were subsequently applied, resulting in an RMSE of 9962.2523 and a MAPE of 2.21, indicating a reasonable forecasting accuracy despite the challenges with data stationarity and seasonal effects.
